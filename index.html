    <h1 id="b">Anika:The Storyteller Between Worlds</h1>
    <img src="images/AnikaAnime.jpg" alt="pretty anime girl with dark hair">
    <p>Born amidst the lotus-filled landscapes of Bangladesh, Anika’s journey began in a place where rickshaws weaved through bustling streets like storylines in an epic tale.
        But fate had grander adventures in store. As a child, she and her family ventured across oceans, settling in the towering realm of New York. 
        With each passing season, she adapted—learning, growing, and shaping herself into a warrior of resilience. 
        She mastered four languages, not as mere words, but as bridges between worlds, each one carrying a piece of her identity.
        With a book forever in hand, Anika walks between realities, diving into realms of fantasy and fiction, where heroines rise and kingdoms fall. 
        The Throne of Glass series is a treasured map of such worlds, guiding her through epic tales of strength and magic. 
        When not lost in pages, she finds wonder in the artistry of anime—Demon Slayer, Studio Ghibli, and Avatar: The Last Airbender—each a masterpiece that fuels her love for breathtaking storytelling.
        Her curiosity extends into the shadows, where true crime documentaries and mystery podcasts whisper secrets of the past, unraveling the hidden depths of human nature.</p>

    <p>Beyond the stories she consumes, Anika is writing one of her own. 
        Passionate about self-discovery and emotional intelligence, she embarks on a personal quest to define peace on her own terms. 
        No longer seeking validation, she has learned to love herself—a victory greater than any throne or treasure. 
        If she could wield any power, she would be a shapeshifter, dancing between forms like the tides of fate, mischief and mystery ever at her side.
        With each day, Anika continues her adventure, crafting her future one chapter at a time. 
        After all, "what you want to be doesn’t change who you are—without work". And she is here to do the work, to grow, and to create a world as vivid and extraordinary as the stories that shaped her.</p>
