# Anika-About-Me-

This project is all about diving into the basics of HTML and CSS while working together as a 
team. Each team member will create an "About Me" page for their partner using notes they've 
exchanged. The goal is to build teamwork, design, and development skills while focusing on 
making responsive and visually appealing layouts.
